Each section is responsible for administering multiple state and federal grants, the programs they fund, and the services they provide to Arkansans.DWS is unique from other state agencies because it is almost 100% federally funded. DWS does not earn a profit, and the agency’s success is measured by its ability to meet the needs of Arkansas employers and job seekers. The Arkansas Legislature appropriates the agency’s funds and has the authority to pass legislation affecting agency programs and services on a state level. As a result, DWS adheres to both state and federal laws and regulations. The size of the agency’s budget and staffing levels are adapted to meet the needs of the state and its customers while balancing the requirements of stakeholders.ADWS Information Desk: 501-682-2121Powered by JazzHR4OHsC6UStf  "

Our success has been built on providing exceptional service to our clients, many of whom are some of the largest lenders in the United States. By utilizing the latest technology and investing in the development of our people, United has experienced continued growth since our inception in 1973. We currently operate out of over 40 branches across the nation and are looking to expand our footprint into more locations soon.One of the key ingredients to our sustained success and growth is our passionate, dedicated and talented Uniteders - that is what we call ourselves. We are more than associates, employees, co-workers - whatever word you want to use to describe a group of people that just work together. Uniteders are family. Uniteders are a group of people that unite together to create a working environment that encourages enthusiasm, comradery, creativity, individuality and grit. In return, we have shaped a culture that is not only different, but one of a kind. We are quirky and weird and different and unique. We are all those things. But collectively, we are UNITEDERS.Due to our companys growth, we are now hiring a full-time Field Investigators for a Sunday - Thursday, 5 p.m. - 2 a.m. shift. In the Field Investigator position, you will drive a late-model, company-issued car in designated areas and locate vehicles that are subject to repossession. You will directly interact with our recovery agents and customers, however you will NOT physically repossess the vehicle. Each car is equipped with in-cab computers so that you always have direct access to your team. Each vehicle is also equipped with MVTRAC camera technology, which scans other vehicle license plates as you drive. This process helps you locate vehicles that are subject for repossession by our recovery agents; they handle the actual repossession, not you! You will also be issued a company-provided fuel card, so all work-related expenses are paid by URR. This position pays a base hourly rate with the opportunity to make plenty of bonuses, based on performance, that can reasonably average between $12-15/hour.United offers intensive training for our newly hired Field Investigators at our corporate headquarters in Collierville, TN (travel, meals, and accommodation are covered by United).

What you should know about titles and onboarding at Manufactured as an early stage startup:We're a ~40 person, Series A startup that has achieved Product-Market Fit. It's a great time to join us.As an early stage company we operate quite differently than larger and later stage companies.As a fast growing company, we have Job Titles that are not stratified yet.Hence, For the titles named ""Lead"", and ""Head of"", here's some context: If it is a ""Head of"" role you will be expected to be a decision-maker in the Company. You will have some team members reporting to you, and the Leadership will rely on you to make day to day decisions based on data, conversation, and inputs from Operators in your team. If it is a ""Lead"" role, you will be expected to be a high agency Individual Contributor that guides Leadership and other Decision Makers with your Operating ability, and will own day to day execution of specific tasks and roles. You are expected to be knowledgeable about your zone of responsibility and have tactical inputs as well as data driven insights around strategic decisions. You should be comfortable understanding the business and mission goals of the business / functional unit you're embedded in and be able to drive task and goal oriented activities independently. Fair Warning about onboarding in an early stage startup in a fast-paced environment:We do not currently have much of a knowledge base inside the company, this is being worked on, but you should be comfortable with this and willing to create order from ambiguity as you execute on daily tasks. We have existing SOPs that are not always documented or codified since they are evolving - A large portion of the embedded expertise comes from cross pollinating team members, learning from recorded calls and studying the transactions both, inside and outside the system and getting your queries answered in real time. Core Values at Manufactured: Manufactured is a small, fast growing startup. We seek team members who resonate with our core values as a means to drive performance, ownership and engagement.Urgency: Always act like an owner, seek help in case of delays beyond 48 hours, move quickly when you have enough information (usually 70-75%), know when to dive in if there's a crisis, and hold true to the best possible timelines without compromising on quality, value or process.Authenticity: Be Authentic, be real, be respectful both, in front of and behind a person's back. If you are frustrated, you're frustrated. If you're stuck, you're stuck. If you're worried, you're worried. Let's support each other in resolving these issues. Be upfront and respectful in your conversation. We are a multi cultural, distributed, global team. Respectful authenticity in communication is critical.Contextual Ownership: Our business is as much about people and relationships as it is about technology and process. We take time to build relationships and understand the needs of our internal and external partners. Context and empathy helps us understand the ""why"". We set goals and drive outcomes based on context and realities, rather than tasks and processes alone.""Effectiveness: Did it work? Did it solve the problem? Was it a short term hack? or a long term process solution that benefits everyone? Was it something we can use to grow / move forward or was it a defensive solution. Did we meet our stakeholders' expectations, did we exceed them? Did our stakeholders all win? Are you using your time correctly? Are you helping your team members use their time well? Are you contributing to the growth of the company?Critical path thinking: ""What is the shortest risk-mitigated route to the Best Potential Outcome?""Further Reading:Our CEO and Founder, Pranay Srinivasan, writes often on LinkedIn about our culture, thesis and operating principles. We recommend these articles in particular:Our Core Operating Thesis: Pranay Srinivasan on LinkedIn: Manufactured is built on a few core operating theses, all of which…Our operating framework ""OBAS"": Pranay Srinivasan on LinkedIn: [08/31/2022] A big part of our work at Manufactured is simplifying a…Our interview process: Interviews are business conversations. We'll treat you with respect. We'll assess you, and you'll assess us. If you're asked to complete a case study we will compensate you for your time.Here's a typical interview process:Founder introduction: You'll meet with one of our Founders, Pranay Srinivasan or Rob Brown. We'll learn more about each other and discuss preliminary role and compensation expectationsSecond Founder interview: If we chose to move forward, you'll then meet with the other Co-Founder. At this point we may introduce a case study or technical interview Primary Interest: We'll have a deeper conversation about you joining the company. We'll get into the details of your role, your onboarding plan, and your offer. We should all come out of this conversation feeling aligned and excited about the future. Often this may also turn into a short term / medium term project that we can align expectations and compensation around so you can learn more about the business and about your operating style. Mutual Diligence: You'll provide our team with three professional references. We'll also conduct our own backchannel references via our networks (we won't contact any current employers). You'll also meet with a few members of our team to learn more about us Verbal offer: All things going well, we'll present you with a verbal offer. You can expect this to be to align with what you discussed at the Primary Interest stage Once you accept we'll send you over the legal documents to get it signed, sealed, and delivered!

Please note that the following requirements may be applied or performed concurrently by the Financial Analyst III in a single project. Budget Preparation and Analysis. Knowledge of this skills is necessary in order to ensure the University effectively manages, protects, and leverages its financial resources; perform highly analytical, complex finance and control functions; multi-dimensional and complex reconciliations and related analysis; develop complex financial analyses: short-term, mid-term, and long­ term consolidated budget and forecasting scenarios based on financial goals and assumptions using drivers such as emollment and research metrics; interpret and make recommendations on a broad range of financial and operating issues; serve as a key member of the Finance, Planning and Analysis team and is the lead in the multi-year funds budgeting for the College of Engineering; compare estimates to actuals, updating forecasts and budgets accordingly; perform root-cause analysis and synthesis, draw conclusions, and propose recommendations on a broad range of financial and operating issues; and create and customize report queries to support annual data reporting to US News & World Report for ranking purposes and operations of the American Society for Engineering Education.UA Uses An Activity-Based Budgeting (ABB) Model At The Institutional Level. This Model Is Designed To Allocate Budget From Revenue Streams Such As Tuition And Research Indirect Cost Recovery. The Model Takes Into Consideration The Below Activities Across Multiple Teaching Modalities (on Campus V/s Online For Example) Major enrollment headcount (undergraduate & graduate studies) Student credit hour (undergraduate & graduate studies) Degree awarded (undergraduate study) Average net tuition revenue per major enrollment headcount (graduate study) Average net tuition revenue per student credit hour (graduate study) Research expendituresUA allocates budget to colleges based on the above activities. The budget is not allocated at the departmental level. But rather, each dean determines how to fund departments within their college after receiving budget allocation from UA. The deans might decide to roll ABB down to departmental level or fund departments based on a different mechanism.ENGR dean funds departments on a zero-based approach, meaning the college will NOT fund a department based on activities generated by thatdepartment, but rather what it costs to run the department. ENGR will absorb any budget impacts at the college administration level.As a result, the budget lead for UA ENGR is required to have extensive knowledge of various budgeting methods taught in managerial and not­ for-profit/governmental accounting, including activity-based and zero­ based. This knowledge would allow ENGR budget lead to understand the impacts of budgeting process and cycle at the institutional level for not­ for-profit/governmental entities like UA, as well as unique accounting issues facing these entities. It would also allow the lead to come up with budget allocations for departments under ENGR on the zero-based approach.This knowledge is required to be able to lead the University of Arizona (UA) College of Engineering (ENGR) multi-year all-fund budgeting process. Financial Forecasting Techniques. Knowledge of this skills is necessary in order to ensure the University effectively manages, protects, and leverages its financial resources; perform highly analytical, complex finance and control functions; multi-dimensional and complex reconciliations and related analysis; develop complex financial analyses: short-term, mid-term, and long­ term consolidated budget and forecasting scenarios based on financial goals and assumptions using drivers such as enrollment and research metrics; interpret and make recommendations on a broad range of financial and operating issues; serve as a key member of the Finance, Planning and Analysis team and is the lead in the multi-year funds budgeting for the College of Engineering; compare estimates to actuals, updating forecasts and budgets accordingly; perform root-cause analysis and synthesis, draw conclusions, and propose recommendations on a broad range of financial and operating issues; and create and customize report queries to support annual data reporting to US News & World Report for ranking purposes and operations of the American Society for Engineering Education.The activity-based budget model at UA is based on activities/metrics such as: Major enrollment headcount (undergraduate & graduate studies) Student credit hour (undergraduate & graduate studies) Degrees awarded (undergraduate study) Average net revenue per major enrollment headcount (graduate study) Average net revenue per student credit hour (graduate study) Research expenditureRequiredEach college is required to submit a 4-year forecast for the above metrics twice per fiscal year. The forecast requires a combination of the followings: Projecting based on historical performance, with considerations given to anomalies. Projecting based on a mix of activities (main campus teaching v/s online campus teaching, in-state student v/s out-of-state student due to different tuition rates). Projecting based on growth assumptions and what-if scenarios.Overall, forecasting the above metrics are similar to the forecasting done in a discounted cash flow (DCF) model that is normally done to value a company or an investment in the financial realm.Working on DCF models requires processing large data sets, such as combing through the company's operational and financial data sets to look for trends and growth inputs. This knowledge is necessary for processing large data sets on ENGR research expenditures to provide to ASEE and USNWR for college ranking purposes. This knowledge is required to be able to develop complex what-if financial analyses for short-term, mid-term, long-term, and compare estimates to actuals for updating forecasts. This knowledge is also required to be able to create and customize report queries to support annual data reporting to American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE) and US News & World Report (USNWR) for college ranking purposes and operations. Accounting Principles and Concepts. Knowledge of this skills is necessary in order to ensure the University effectively manages, protects, and leverages its financial resources; perform highly analytical, complex finance and control functions; multi-dimensional and complex reconciliations and related analysis; develop complex financial analyses: short-term, mid-term, and long­ term consolidated budget and forecasting scenarios based on financial goals and assumptions using drivers such as enrollment and research metrics; interpret and make recommendations on a broad range of financial and operating issues; serve as a key member of the Finance, Planning and Analysis team and is the lead in the multi-year funds budgeting for the College of Engineering; compare estimates to actuals, updating forecasts and budgets accordingly; perform root-cause analysis and synthesis, draw conclusions, and propose recommendations on a broad range of financial and operating issues; and create and customize report queries to support annual data reporting to US News & World Report for ranking purposes and operations of the American Society for Engineering Education.Besides The Activity-based Budget, UA ENGR Also Receives Congressional adds for: New Economy Initiative (state funding to develop a skilled and diverse workforce and to enhance economic opportunity) Cancer Engineering (state funding to help improve cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment) Hypersonic Wind Tunnel (state and federal funding for wind tunnel with capabilities typically not seen at universities, because it's usually reserved for government facilities like NASA) School of Mining and Mineral Resources (state funding geared toward building a highly educated workforce prepared to meet some of the most pressing technological needs around mineral resources) Differential tuition (tuition charges above UA standard tuition rate for undergrad study) and course-specific fee due to higher instructional costs for engineering fields and certain engineering courses. Restricted gifts and scholarship endowments.Each Of The Above Fundings Comes With a Different Set Of Accounting Rules And Restrictions. ENGR Budget Lead Needs To Take Into Consideration All Rules And Restrictions To Ensure That Appropriate Expenditures Are Matched Against Appropriate Funding Source And The Timing Of The Matching. Some Of The Applicable Principles And Concepts Are Accrual accounting (requires transactions to be recorded in the time period in which they occur, regardless of when the actual cash flows for the transaction are received) Fund accounting (appropriated fund v/s non-appropriated fund) Matching principle (report expenses at the same time as the revenues they are related to)As a result, a strong foundational knowledge of general accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and specific accounting standards for not­ for-profit/governmental entities are required. Accounting Communication. Knowledge of this skills is necessary in order to ensure the University effectively manages, protects, and leverages its financial resources; perform highly analytical, complex finance and control functions; multi-dimensional and complex reconciliations and relatedanalysis; develop complex financial analyses: short-term, mid-term, and long­ term consolidated budget and forecasting scenarios based on financial goals and assumptions using drivers such as enrollment and research metrics; interpret and make recommendations on a broad range of financial and operating issues; serve as a key member of the Finance, Planning and Analysis team and is the lead in the multi-year funds budgeting for the College of Engineering; compare estimates to actuals, updating forecasts and budgets accordingly; perform root-cause analysis and synthesis, draw conclusions, and propose recommendations on a broad range of financial and operating issues; and create and customize report queries to support annual data reporting to US News & World Report for ranking purposes and operations of the American Society for Engineering Education.Most of the time, complex budgeting and accounting issues need to be communicated to ENGR leadership so that a budgeting decision or a solution can be made to address the issues. The targeted audience might or might not have the necessary accounting or financial background to completely and quickly grasp the technical reasons behind the issues. An example would be explaining to department heads the impacts of faculty workload (how many courses to teach per academic year) and enrollment management decisions (to offer or to not offer a course during a semester) on budget outcomes for ENGR. Another example would be explaining why certain funding sources have certain restrictions on what types of expenditure can be accepted.As a result, the skill to craft a straightforward story/explanation around a complex budgeting or accounting issue and to clearly articulate that story/explanation is required to perform the job successfully. The accounting communication skill is specifically taught to accounting majors at the graduate study level.This skill is required to be able to lead ENGR budgeting process and ensure ENGR effectively manages, protects, and leverages its financial resources.Minimum QualificationsMaster’s degree in Accounting, Finance, Business Administration, Public Administration, or foreign equivalent.

PEOI proposes to do that by structuring all its courses as open platforms that include all methods of learning. Open platform means that anyone can use the content (i.e. everything on PEOI is free and open), and that anyone can add or change any content, provided the contributor is registered, and the content is verified by at least an editor or coordinator. Methods of learning must include reading require text, reading of additional explanatory material, verifying memorized concepts, writing assignments, assembling empirical evidence, testing validity of concepts and hypotheses, comparing alternative theories and ideas, understanding limitations of currently popular strategies and policies, critical thinking, exchanging ideas (e.g. in class discussion), go through exercises and testing of knowledge on major concepts. This comprehensive package of learning is what makes PEOI unique among open education and knowledge websites.Altough PEOI's goal is to disseminate free and open knowledge just as wikipedia, PEOI is different from wikipedia (and other wikis) because of the diversity of its learning methods. Whereas wikis offer open knowledge, PEOI offers methods of understanding, verifying, discussing, memorising and testing knowledge. Moreover, each page of content at PEOI is part of body of knowledge organized by course subject which is commonly taught in units of 15 weeks university semesters, and in turn, each course is part of a program of studies necessary for professional qualifications. (Mastery of professional qualifications normally leads to award of a university degree; although PEOI is now far from being ready to award any such degree, that is the aim). Because of the variety of content in each of PEOI's courses, there is a need for diverse skills in developing course content. Authors at PEOI do not all need to be good writers. Much of the content may already exist, can be imported if it is not copyright restricted, and placed on PEOI with proper attribution; thus, for some contributors above average computer skills are most important. Also, some of PEOI's course content such as summaries of concepts and test questions is developed using automated PEOI's procedures, and editing skills are more important then than just writing skills. Another difference with wikipedia is that PEOI's open platform does not deal with just one content page format, but numerous different data banks, and this makes navigation and work in PEOI's course development more difficult. Content contributors must take some time to learn how to navigate PEOI, and use PEOI's procedures.PEOI's courses are also very different from online commercial courses (as well as online courses at most universities) because PEOI's students do not have to comply with scheduled deadlines, do not work with one instructor, and are not evaluated by one appointed faculty (not to mention, that they are not tied to the commitment resulting from having paid a tuition fee). Online commercial courses are primarily based 1) reading of a purchased textbook (plus occasional lecture notes or video) and 2) one or a couple graded big assignments. As shown in ""Course content"" below, PEOI courses contain a large quantity and diversity of materials. The reason for that is that free and open education such as the one at PEOI must give a self-learner everything that one needs PEOI's students must not have to purchase any book or visit any library (which in many cases may not exist where students live), and knowledge assessment at PEOI must be automated so that a student does not have to rely on an instruThis is a volunteer opportunity provided by VolunteerMatch, in partnership with LinkedIn for Good.
